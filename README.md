# 🚀 Malyka Sardar | 4th-Year Software Engineering Student

👋 Hi there! I'm Malyka — a final-year Software Engineering student at Ontario Tech University in Canada. I specialize in full-stack development, systems programming, and cloud technologies.

As a creative at heart, I love the freedom to design custom UX/UI experiences tailored to the applications I engineer. I enjoy solving real-world problems through thoughtful engineering — from building clean interfaces to working with low-level system tools.

I've even started turning my projects into a small business, offering services from web design to practical app development. Right now, I'm building an app to streamline job applications after having a tough time landing a co-op. My mission? To make an impact in the software world with a strong capstone and a portfolio of meaningful projects.
