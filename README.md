# 👩‍💻 Malyka Sardar | 4th-Year Software Engineer & Co-op Student @ Ontario Tech University 🇨🇦

Hi, I'm **Malyka** — a Canadian software engineer who can architect solutions, not just write code. I specialize in **full-stack development**, **systems programming**, and **cloud technologies**.

As a creative at heart, I love designing custom UX/UI experiences that bring my technical builds to life. I thrive on solving real-world problems through thoughtful engineering — from clean frontends to low-level system tools.

Recently, I’ve been turning my personal projects into a small business — building and offering custom websites, applications, and tools that automate everyday tasks. I'm currently developing a job-application agent using **n8n** and **LLMs** like GPT to help streamline the job search process — for others and myself.
